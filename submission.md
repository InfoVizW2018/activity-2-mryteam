## Description
Outlined below is a description of our solution in terms of the "What, Why, How" framework.

### What

#### Datasets
* **Data Types**: 
  * Items: Departure time, Arrival time, Boat load
  * Links:
  * Positions: Current boat location; i.e. distance between the boat and berth
* **Data and Dataset Types**: Networks & Trees
* **Dataset Types**: 
  * Tables: Docks will show a table contatining the departure and arrival time
  * Networks:
* **Dataset Availability**: 
  * Dynamic: Position of the vessel and estimated arrival/departure time updates in real time. 

#### Attributes
* **Attribute Types**: 
  * Categorical: Dock and bearth location
  * Ordered Quantitative:
